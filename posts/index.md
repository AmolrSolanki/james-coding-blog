# Joys Of Apex Overview

The [Joys Of Apex](https://www.jamessimone.net/blog/joys-of-apex/) began in 2019 as a tongue-in-cheek resource for the Salesforce.com (SFDC) community to commiserate on the mutual frustrations and issues faced by everyday developers on the Salesforce platform, but it has evolved into a knowledge-base and movement for Salesforce developers who are passionate about improving the quality and runtime behavior of their code.

Utilizing some 7+ years of SFDC platform knowledge, I document the triumps and tribulations of working within a programming language lacking first-class functions, generics, and proper reflection. While those limitations are painful, they're also a significant source of focus; because the platform only allows you to do things in a certain way, there are often interesting and inspirational lessons to be learned when writing Apex.

Join me as we walk through principles like [Dependency Injection](/dependency-injection-factory-pattern), [proper use of mocks within Apex](/mocking-dml), creating [reusable Lightning Web Components](/lwc-composable-pagination), and much much more.
